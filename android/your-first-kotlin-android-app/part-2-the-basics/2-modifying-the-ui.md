# 10 - Modifying the UI

We created the empty start project in part one of this course along with a to-do list of tasks needed to complete our game, Time Fighter.

 Let's start crossing off some of those items in our list. Taking a look at our list,

* **Add a "Tap ME" button**
* **Add text for the game score**
* **Add text for the time left**
* ...

add a Tap Me button,  add text for the game score,  add text for the time left. These three items are to add UI elements to Time Fighter, and that is always a good place to start.  Being able to see what you are building lets you get the ball rolling when you're developing an app. It's the first thing your user will see and interact with. The game logic and what happens when users interact with your UI are all behind the scenes in what are called activities. We'll get to activities in part three of this course.

A well thought-out and intuitive UI goes a long way towards making a successful app. If the user does not understand how your app works, or if it is not clear what a specific button or control does, your users might not like using it. So, getting the UI right is essential. Thankfully, Android Studio gives you the necessary tools to build a good UI. The layout file `activity_main.xml`
