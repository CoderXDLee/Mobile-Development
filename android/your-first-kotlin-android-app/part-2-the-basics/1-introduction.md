# 9 - Introduction

In part two of Your First Kotlin Android App, we are going to get elbow deep in Android Studio.  In part one of this course, we created a to-do list of everything we need to get our app finished.  

A good place to start when building applications is with the user interface. In many modern IDE's, such as Android Studio, there are tools that help design and create user interfaces, more commonly known as UI. These tools make it easy to add elements to your application. We'll also go over customizing the screen elements by learning how to use the visual screen builder. You'll be glad later because learning the ins and outs of the visual screen builder will help you create your own apps that much faster.

Let's get to it.
