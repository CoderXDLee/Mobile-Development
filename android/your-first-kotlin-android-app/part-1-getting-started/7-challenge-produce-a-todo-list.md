# 7 - Challenge: Produce a Todo List

Great job getting this far into the course. You now have a development environment set up and ready to go.  All right, so far you've been following along with what I've been doing.  Now it's time to turn the tables. This episode is a challenge episode. 

Through this course and other courses on raywenderlich.com, we use challenge episodes to give you the chance to take the initiative to complete a task yourself.  Before we start churning out code,  it's important to have a list of things we want to do.

As I mentioned earlier,  we will be developing a game called Time Fighter.  It's a frenzied game testing your accuracy, dexterity, and mental acuity as you race against time.  To start the game, tap the single button on the center of the screen.  You then have 60 seconds to tap the same button as many times as you can.  Each tap of the button increases your score by one.  When the timer runs out, your app will notify you of the score and resets the game to be played again.

This may sound simple, but if you haven't built your own app before, it can be fairly complicated to execute.  This is where coming up with a to-do list comes in handy.  Think about ways you can break down the game into bite-sized chunks.  Even just the act of thinking about the problem and writing things down is enough to make the biggest challenges more manageable.

Now on to the challenge. Take a few minutes by pausing the video. Write down everything you think you might need to get the game working.  Think about the actions the player takes,  how the game looks, and what the rules are. Don't focus too much on how to code any of this out.  That will come soon enough. Focus on understanding the problem and breaking it down.  This is one of the most valuable skills as a developer.  Make a list as detailed as possible. There are no right or wrong answers.  The objective is just learning how to think about the problem.

Now pause the video and get started!

All right, all done? Here's what I came up with.

* Add a "Tap ME" button
* Add text for the game score
* Add text for the time left
* When you tap the button, the game starts and the timer counts down
* Tapping the button again increments the score
* When the timer reaches zero, show the score and reset the game
* When the phone is held in landscape mode, rotate the game
* It should look nice
* Submit it to the Google Play Store.

Add a button that says Tap Me in the middle of the screen. Add text to show the game score.  Add text to show the time left. When you tap the Tap Me button, the game starts and the timer counts down.  Tapping the button again increments the score. When the timer reaches zero, show the score, When the phone is held in landscape,  rotate the game. It should look nice. And submit it to the Google Play Store.

Our lists may not be similar or comprehensive, but it should be good enough to start working!

Let's get to it!
