# Push Notifications

In this course, you'll learn everything you need to create, send, and receive both remote and local push notifications. You’ll learn how to create push notifications that open a specific view controller, display buttons, modify the payload, download media attachments, display a custom UI with user input & interaction, and are created & delivered locally on the user’s device.
